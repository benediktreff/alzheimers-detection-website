This repository contains the code and resources for a streamlit application for a deep learning model to classify MRI brain slices. The model is specifically trained to work with axial slices, focusing on the central slice of the brain.


## Introduction

This project serves as the frontend for a deep learning model to classify MRI images of the brain. The model aims to accurately identify specific features or conditions present in the central axial slice of brain MRI scans. It predicts three classes: Non-demented, very mild dementia, and mild dementia.

## Model

You can find the model in the following github repository: https://github.com/murasovl/alzheimers-detection


## Package Details

- **Diagnosis.py**: Main page of the web-application
- **pages**: Containing sub-page 'About' for additional information
